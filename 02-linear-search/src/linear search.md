pseudo code :--

1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2. If x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesn’t match with any of elements, return -1.


time complexity :

--> The time complexity of linear search algorithm is O(n).
